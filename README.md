# CS-230-Operating-Platforms Portfolio

<h2>The Gaming Room Project</h2>
<p>The Gaming Room is a ficticious client that has a gaming application - **Draw It Or Lose It** - created for the Android system. They want to expand this game to other operating platforms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Draw It or Lose It is a game that shares some similarities with the 1980s television game show Win, Lose or Draw. In this game, teams compete against each other to guess the subject of a drawing. However, instead of a player manually drawing images on an easel to help their team guess the puzzle (which can be a phrase, title, or thing), the game application will generate images from a large collection of stock drawings to serve as clues. Each game consists of four rounds, each lasting one minute. The images are generated steadily and are fully displayed by the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle within the time limit, the other teams will have an opportunity to offer one guess each within a 15-second time limit to solve the puzzle.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>For this project, I populated a system design document with content that allowed the client to make a variety of decisions about:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An Executive Summary</li>
  <li>System Design Requirements</li>
  <li>Design Constraints</li>
  <li>A System Architectural View</li>
  <li>The Domain Model</li>
  <li>Final Evaluation</li>
  <li>A Recommendation for Operating Platform Vendor</li>
</ol>

<p>The requirements pushed students to perform research and update the document as a working copy. The document compared and contrasted the company's requirements and a variety of vendor solutions that would facilitate those requirements. I compared Apple, Windows, Ancroid, and Linux-based operating platforms to convey the pros and cons of using each choice.</p>

<h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>
<p>The design document gave students a framework to operate within. I used the design document like a linguistic skeleton to support the development of solutions to the client's requests. The design document dramatically sped up the process of giving the client the information needed to make an informed operating platform choice decision.</p>
