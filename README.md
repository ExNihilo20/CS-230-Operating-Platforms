<h2>The Gaming Room Project</h2>
<p>The Gaming Room is a ficticious client that has a gaming application - **Draw It Or Lose It** - created for the Android system. They want to expand this game to other operating platforms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Draw It or Lose It is a game that shares some similarities with the 1980s television game show Win, Lose or Draw. In this game, teams compete against each other to guess the subject of a drawing. However, instead of a player manually drawing images on an easel to help their team guess the puzzle (which can be a phrase, title, or thing), the game application will generate images from a large collection of stock drawings to serve as clues. Each game consists of four rounds, each lasting one minute. The images are generated steadily and are fully displayed by the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle within the time limit, the other teams will have an opportunity to offer one guess each within a 15-second time limit to solve the puzzle.</p>
