# CS-230-Operating-Platforms Portfolio

<h2>The Gaming Room Project</h2>
<p>The Gaming Room is a ficticious client that has a gaming application - **Draw It Or Lose It** - created for the Android system. They want to expand this game to other operating platforms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Draw It or Lose It is a game that shares some similarities with the 1980s television game show Win, Lose or Draw. In this game, teams compete against each other to guess the subject of a drawing. However, instead of a player manually drawing images on an easel to help their team guess the puzzle (which can be a phrase, title, or thing), the game application will generate images from a large collection of stock drawings to serve as clues. Each game consists of four rounds, each lasting one minute. The images are generated steadily and are fully displayed by the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle within the time limit, the other teams will have an opportunity to offer one guess each within a 15-second time limit to solve the puzzle.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>For this project, I populated a system design document with content that allowed the client to make a variety of decisions about:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An Executive Summary</li>
  <li>System Design Requirements</li>
  <li>Design Constraints</li>
  <li>A System Architectural View</li>
  <li>The Domain Model</li>
  <li>Final Evaluation</li>
  <li>A Recommendation for Operating Platform Vendor</li>
</ol>

<p>The requirements pushed students to perform research and update the document as a working copy. The document compared and contrasted the company's requirements and a variety of vendor solutions that would facilitate those requirements. I compared Apple, Windows, Ancroid, and Linux-based operating platforms to convey the pros and cons of using each choice.</p>

<h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>
<p>The design document gave students a framework to operate within. I used the design document like a linguistic skeleton to support the development of solutions to the client's requests. The design document dramatically sped up the process of giving the client the information needed to make an informed operating platform choice decision.</p>

<h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>
<p>The only part of the document that I would consider revising is the requirements section. I would break the requirement's section down by category and use that to compile a structured document system so that different parts of the operating platforms assignment could be worked simultaneously by different project leads / project managers.

<h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3>
<p>It is important to understand the underlying platforms and technologies that will be used in a project up front, instead of coding on the fly. The design document allowed me to consider server technologies, network topologies, network security, needs, user content needs, overall game content structure, and ways to extend the game to include new features once the game moved into the development and testing phases.</p>

<h3>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</h3>
<p>I used an iterative approach that modified the document multiple times a week. The work was spread out over the course to avoid a rushed conclusion. Content added to the document considers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Components needed</li>
  <li>Platform-specific / Cross-platform architecture</li>
  <li>Data exchange between diverse platforms</li>
  <li>Security and access control</li>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Languages used</li>
  <li>Cross-Platform implementation strategies</li>

The above list is not exhaustive, as there are pros and cons to options that the client ultimately chooses. Aside from the above list, storage management, memory management, distributed systems and networks, and more were considered in the recommendation for a final oparating platform strategy to build the game. The client is well-positioned from an information perspective to move forward with a variety of options.
</ul>
